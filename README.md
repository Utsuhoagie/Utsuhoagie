Some guy in Vietnam. I'm pretty boring.

Learning web development for future work. 
Also an aspiring hobbyist game dev, will probably do it once in a while if time allows.

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on: A tag-based imageboard that I hope to extend to other forms of media (such as text, any files, or YouTube playlists)
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning: React, React Native, ASP.NET Core, Go; Godot, Unity
- ðŸ¤” I'm planning to learn: SolidJS, general .NET, Flutter, software architecture (...when I'm good enough for that anyway)
- âš¡ Fun fact: gamers are truly oppressed by society
